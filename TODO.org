* TODO Lister les articles pour un tag
* TODO Automatically remove published pages

If an article, a tag index, etc. got removed, it's published counterpart
should be also removed.

Currently we have only a rake task for that (~rake site:clean~), which is not
advertized, nor automatic (actually itâ€™s even an interactive task).

* Around themes/templates
** TODO Allow themes to provide configuration options

Themes should be able to declare a set of default ~templates~ or
specific Org export options

** TODO Create a themes portfolio

* TODO Better protected upgrade

For example, Rakefile should only be overwritten after upgrade of the
gem.

This means we should always keep a flag in the tmp folder to remember
what was the old fronde version

* TODO Support activity pub

See https://www.emadelsaid.com/ActivityPub/ and
