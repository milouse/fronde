- Does not require any server-side code, nor databases, only a simple
  http server like apache, nginx, lighttpd, hiawatha…
- Allows fine customization of generated html files

  you wish in the destination folder
- Can use different themes for different sources

* Quick install

Fronde is a [[https://rubygems.org/][Ruby gem]]. You need a working Ruby environment to use it. We
recommend that you use [[https://rvm.io][RVM]] and a specific gemset. However fronde works
with a global ruby installation too.
